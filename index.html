        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">I recently embarked on a journey to create a web page using Tailwind CSS. Here's how it went:</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">Installing Tailwind CSS</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">Getting started with Tailwind CSS was the first step. Here's what I did:</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">Installing Tailwind CSS was not that hard, all I had to do was use the CDN already given to me on their website. There are also other ways of installing it such as using npm install. Steps are given in great detail on their website.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">Building My Web Page</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">With Tailwind CSS installed, I started creating this web page. It was both exciting and challenging. The utility-first approach of Tailwind greatly simplified the styling process. I could rapidly prototype and see changes in real-time, which was incredibly satisfying. The ability to customize designs without leaving the HTML was a game-changer for me, making the development process more streamlined and enjoyable.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">My Struggles and Solutions</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">During this journey, I faced some hurdles, but I found solutions along the way:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 pl-6 mt-2">
                <li><strong>Conflicting Styles:</strong> I encountered conflicts with existing styles. To resolve this, I used the '!' prefix to force apply Tailwind CSS classes, e.g., 'class="!bg-blue-500".'</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Creating a responsive design was a challenge. I used responsive classes like 'lg:text-xl' to apply styles only on larger screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization Limitations:</strong> Initially, I struggled with the limitations in color and spacing customization. However, I learned to extend the Tailwind config and create custom classes that suited my needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> Understanding the utility-first concept was initially overwhelming, but with practice and reference to the documentation, it became intuitive and significantly sped up my workflow.</li>
